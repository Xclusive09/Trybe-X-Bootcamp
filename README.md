Life has been a journey. And every human has to embrace everything it takes to succeed while trying possible best to make sure a remarkable project during the process of learning. In this articles I'll be walking you through my learning process with Trybe-X Bootcamp Week 1 of My learning.. ü§ó

Like I said; I'll be sharing with you all my little knowledge on what I've learned so far on Trybe-X Academy first week of intensive tutorial by tutor: *Mr. Qudus.*

Knowing the fundamentals of how the internet works is quite interesting and that alone will make you want to learn more about the web and how it works.

## Understanding the Internet

If you take a look at how the internet works and how it works, the internet is a world wide web known as the ‚Äúwww‚Äù and also the inter-connection of networks together. With the help of the internet users school easily access files resources easily from the internet why it is possible this is possible because of the intercon connection of the network together.

And if we are to go deeper you will discover that without a URL which is the universal resource locator for a unique identity of a server or a website a user cannot access the internet.

There must be a ‚ÄúNetwork A‚Äù and also a ‚ÄúNetwork B‚Äù interconnecting together and this very connection together it is not just for sharing of information it could be also for accessing information online and resources.

## Introduction to Web Technologies

If you're talking about web Technologies it is more as in details. An advancement of how the internet has grown to an extent of developing a different web.

Now let's break it down what is web Technologies.

Web is developed page by page to make sure with the help of basic *HTML* and style with *CSS* to store or provide information on each page that is created.

Technology is an advanced programming language like PHP, JavaScript and others used to make sure each and every page is interactive and working fine together.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Talking about setting up your development environment is also referred to as a dev environment, well in my own understanding talking about an environment is a hub or tools used in development like the IDE, Gits and lots more‚Ä¶

## Basics of Command Line

Talking about the command line and how they work for the first week of learning the Trybe-X Bootcamp course, what I understand so far is ‚Äúcommand lines‚Äù are text surface areas like some set of instructions or some set of commands that is being given to the computer for a productive output which are often called ‚Äúprompts‚Äù.

## Introduction to Web Development Workflow

What can you do? A step-by-step guide on web development workflow and some related tips on what I understand.

A web development workflow is all it takes to structure a complete and functioning web project. Through its design of the website or the project itself starting from the planning and design.

Talking about ‚Äúplanning‚Äù is a fundamental basic goal of what you want and every feature you want also.

While the ‚Äúdesign‚Äù is a user interface or user experience this could actually mean sketching a structure of how you want your web pages to look like.

And after that we head to the front end development using the basic design structure HTML and CSS.

Lots of users wonder how the front-end works with data storage or thinks after creating an HTML and CSS structure that's all.

Nope, this brought us to API: which means application programming interface. This is mostly used in connecting both front and backend together and it's also used in different aspects.

Backend Development is often written in a programming language like PHP, Nodejs and python.. while it's a server-side tho.

A lot to learn in as much as we continue, but so far this is what I have learned so far regarding the first week of Trybe-X Bootcamp. Although still having some basic knowledge on how most works.

I'm happy sharing with you all, my little knowledge based on the topic I have talk about on this page.
